Collection of machine learning projects in R, including data preprocessing, modeling, and performance evaluation across classification and regression tasks.

1. Gender Statistics and Hapiness Index

   This project analyzes the relationship between World Bank Gender Statistics and the World Happiness Index (World Happiness Report) to identify which gender-related factors most influence national happiness levels. After data cleaning and merging multiple datasets, dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA (validated with bootstrap and permutation tests), followed by Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Lasso regression with cross-validation for prediction and variable selection. The models were evaluated using MSE and applied to out-of-sample country predictions.
